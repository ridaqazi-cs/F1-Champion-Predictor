F1 Pitstop Champion Prediction

This repository contains a Python pipeline to predict Formula 1 season champions using pitstop and race data from 2018 to 2024. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory visualization, model training, and evaluation.

Project Overview

Predict which driver will become the Formula 1 World Champion next season by leveraging pitstop performance, weather, and race metrics. We train four classifiers:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Naive Bayes

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

and compare their performance.

Pipeline Steps

Load & Encode Drivers

Read the CSV into a pandas DataFrame.

Convert driver names to numeric codes using pd.factorize.

Compute Season Points & Champions

Map finishing positions to FIA points (25 for 1st, 18 for 2nd, etc.).

Sum points per driver per season.

Flag the driver with the highest points as champion.

Clean & Drop Columns

Remove unneeded text columns (race name, date, location, etc.).

Keep only numeric and categorical features for modeling.

Handle Missing Values

Numeric: Fill missing with column medians.

Categorical: Fill missing with column modes.

Aggregate Features

Group by Season & DriverCode to one row per driver-season.

Numeric: Mean or sum for continuous metrics.

Mode: Most common Constructor and Tire Compound.

Label: Max of IsChampion.

Exploratory Visualizations

Correlation matrix of numeric features.

Top 10 feature importances from a quick Random Forest.

Feature Selection & Importances

Apply SelectKBest (ANOVA F-test) to score all features.

Plot the highest-scoring features.

Prepare ML Dataset

Create ChampionNext by shifting IsChampion to next season.

Split into train (≤2022) and test (2023).

Drop identifier columns (Season, DriverCode).

Model Training & Evaluation

Balance classes with RandomOverSampler.

Train models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, KNN.

Evaluate on 2023 data: accuracy, weighted F1, classification report, confusion matrix.

Final Model & 2025 Prediction

Retrain the best model on all data up to 2023.

Predict championship probabilities for 2024 drivers.

Output the top-5 drivers by probability.
